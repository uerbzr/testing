## Test Coverage Overview

This project explores how to collect and report code coverage across both unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests in a modern frontend stack. While tools like Jest and Vitest offer built-in coverage reporting for unit tests, Playwright can also trigger coverage collection during E2E tests â€” provided the app is instrumented using Istanbul. Instrumentation means injecting tracking hooks into the appâ€™s source code (e.g., via `vite-plugin-istanbul`) so that coverage data can be recorded as users interact with the app. By combining unit-level coverage with real-world usage coverage from Playwright, we gain a more complete picture of which parts of the codebase are tested, used, and potentially under-tested.
